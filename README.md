# R-code
A repository of simple R code
This consists of various models (both supervised and unsupervised) applied to various data sets for predictions as well as classifications

P4:
compare the accuracy of regression on a given data set for different subset selection and different regularization methods

1.R and 2.R takes a cereal data set and does data exploration, finds and removes outliers and then does prediction with several of the features and their combination,
3.R compares the accuracy of KNN and regression with different values for K

hclust.R: shows heirarchical clustering on a sample data, and shows different types of linkage

SOM.r: Self organizing maps, hclust_kmeans.R : comparison between heirarchial clustering and kmeans clustrering, SOM_hclust.R : comparison between SOM and heirarchial clustering, Dtree.R : Dtree on wine data set to, Rforest.R : select the best m for random forest and spam data set

p5.R : comparision of random forest, KNN, regression, bagging and boosting for RMSE on boston data set

SVM.R : SVM with different kernals on OJ data set to compare train and test errors
